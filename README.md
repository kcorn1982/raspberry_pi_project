# Raspberry Pi Projects

I'm continually messing around with various Pi's and am continually going through image builds and setting things up from the ground up.

I have created various server builds, built various Kali machines for tinkering, live streaming cameras, stop motion cameras and more. I have foolishly, rarely documented any of if it.

This project aims to change that and share it with everyone.

## The aim of this project

Although Raspberry Pi's are perfect machines for getting started with hardware, programing and more there are some things that are either repetitive or require a little know how if you're starting for the first time.

I will be documenting as much as I can to help people get started, educae where I can and help people automate some of the basic repetition.

## Pre-requisites

Although I'm building this for all there are some small steps that you should be able to take from the basic documentation of getting started or if you've simply

The following steps take into account that:

- you are using a Linux or Mac - I'll look into windows instructions at a later date
- you have installed a desktop server such as Raspios (bullseye verions at the time of writing this guide) on a Raspberry Pi
- Have gone through the basic setup and have connected to the internet through WiFi or Ethernet
- All instructions in here will be as generic as possible when talking about routers. However, for rederence an ASUS router was used for this guide
