# Raspberry Pi Setup

I'm continually messing around with various Pi's and am continually going through image builds and setting things up from the ground up.

So, in the classic case of not continually repeating myself I have put together some instructions and files to help automate a lot of the setup some of which I hope you'll find useful.

The sections within this setup folder relate to general setup measures. Where possible scripts will be included to make things easier.

## Pre-requisites

The following steps take into account that:

- you are using a Linux or Mac - I'll look into windows instructions at a later date
- you have installed a desktop server such as Raspios (bullseye verions at the time of writing this guide) on a Raspberry Pi
- Have gone through the basic setup and have connected to the internet through WiFi or Ethernet
- All instructions in here will be as generic as possible when talking about routers. However, for rederence an ASUS router was used for this guide
